Vector Graphics 2.1.1 Release Notes

	Release Notes Version: $Revision: 10163 $.

	The most recent version of this file is available at
{{http://java.freehep.org/vectorgraphics/ReleaseNotes-2.1.1.html}}.

    Release notes for all versions of the VectorGraphics package are available at
{{http://java.freehep.org/vectorgraphics/ReleaseNotes.html}}.

	The VectorGraphics package of {{{http://java.freehep.org}
FreeHEP Java Library}} enables any Java program to export to a variety of
vector graphics formats as well as bitmap image formats. Among the vector formats are PostScript, PDF, EMF,
SVF, and (Flash) SWF. The image formats
include GIF, PNG, JPG, BMP, WBPM and PPM. All image formats included in the Java runtime, as well as any in the Java
Advanced Imaging package (if installed) are also be available.
A special JAVA export format will write a java file with all the calls your application
makes to Graphics2D. This java file can help us debug any potential problems.

    The formats CGM and LaTeX have not been released in version 2.1.1. They 
may be released at a later date/version. 

	The package uses the standard java.awt.Graphics2D class as its interface to
the user program. Using this package from any Java GUI program is therefore
quite easy. It also comes with a dialog box which allows you to choose between
all the formats mentioned above and set specific parameters for them.

* {Major Changes}
        
    This version is binary compatible at the java.awt.Graphics2d level with version 2.0. However if you
used classes/methods from the low-level format drivers or have used methods of the VectorGraphics class
or its descendants you may have to adjust your code and recompile.

    This version runs on Java 1.4.2 and up, but has only been tested mildly in Java 1.6.0.
		
	Below the major changes in general and by format:	
			
** General	

    * [{{{http://bugs.freehep.org/browse/FVG-314}FVG-314}}] - bin tar and zip file contains multiple versions of freehep-io and freehep-util

    * [{{{http://bugs.freehep.org/browse/FVG-315}FVG-315}}] - Update dep of jas-plotter to 2.2

* {Documentation}

	The following documentation is currently available:

  * {{{http://java.freehep.org/vectorgraphics}The VectorGraphics 
  website}}
  
  * {{{http://java.freehep.org/vectorgraphics/Manual.html}The 
  VectorGraphics User Manual}}


* {Test Output}

    To better understand the behaviour of the VectorGraphics package for different usage on different
Operating Systems and with different JDK's we publish the test results (and a PNG reference) on 
our website: {{http://java.freehep.org/vectorgraphics}}.


* {License}

	The VectorGraphics package is part of the {{{http://java.freehep.org/}FreeHEP Java Library}}, 
an "Open Source" library distributed under the terms of the
{{{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html}LGPL}}. If you have 
questions about the licensing please send a mail to:
{{{mailto:developers@freehep.org}developers@freehep.org}}.


* {Installation}

    All distributions for the VectorGraphics package can be donwloaded from 
{{ftp://ftp.slac.stanford.edu/software/freehep/VectorGraphics/v2.1.1}}.

	Download the binary distribution vectorgraphics-2.1.1-bin.tar.gz or the .zip file and unpack. 
It creates the following directory structure:

+--
vectorgraphics-2.1.1            containing license and release notes
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/bin        empty
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/examples   containing examples
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/lib        containing jar files
+--

    You may optionally download the documentation distribution vectorgraphics-2.1.1-doc.tar.gz or the .zip file
and unpack. It creates the following directory structure:

+--
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/doc        empty
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/site       containing a copy of the website, including these release notes.
+--


* {Compilation}

	The source distribution contain all source files and can be used for recompilation. 
Unless you wish to make modifications, you can just use the binary distribution.
	
	To (re-)build the VectorGraphics package you need:
	
    * The Java Development Kit (JDK), version 1.4.2 or up.
    
    * Maven, version 2.0.4 or up, see {{http://maven.apache.org}}.
    
    * Subversion, version 1.3 or up, see {{http://subversion.tigris.org}}. 
      You only need subversion if you want to build from our source repository.
    
    []

    Get the source code in one of the following ways:

    * Download the source distribution vectorgraphics-2.1.1-src.tar.gz or .zip file and unpack.
    
    * Check out a copy of the source code either from a tagged version:
	
+--
cd vectorgraphics-2.1.1
svn co svn://svn.freehep.org/svn/freehep/tags/vectorgraphics-2.1.1 src
+--

    * If you like to live on the edge from the HEAD of svn:

+--
cd vectorgraphics-2.1.1
svn co svn://svn.freehep.org/svn/freehep/trunk/vectorgraphics src
+--

    []

    All of these will create a directory in which you will find all VectorGraphics modules:

+--
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/src/freehep-graphics2d
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/src/freehep-graphics3d        (to be ignored)
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/src/freehep-graphicsio
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/src/freehep-graphicsio-cgm    (not included in this release, but available for compilation)
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/src/freehep-graphicsio-emf
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/src/freehep-graphicsio-java   
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/src/freehep-graphicsio-latex  (not included in this release, but available for compilation)
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/src/freehep-graphicsio-pdf
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/src/freehep-graphicsio-ps
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/src/freehep-graphicsio-svg
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/src/freehep-graphicsio-swf
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/src/freehep-graphicsio-tests
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/src/pom.xml
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/src/site/...                  (the website and files for building the distributions)
vectorgraphics-2.1.1/src/..                        (other files)
+--
	
    To compile and run the tests type the following:

+--
cd vectorgraphics-2.1.1/src
mvn
+--

    To recreate the full distribution
    
+--
cd vectorgraphics-2.1.1/src
mvn javadoc:javadoc             (creates aggregated apidoc)
mvn site:site                   (creates top-level site, module-sites and module-apidoc)
mvn install assembly:attached   (compiles, runs tests and creates -bin, -doc and -src distributions) 
+--
