Originally this software has been licensed under LGPL (see LGPL.txt),
but has been changed to GPL2 with classpath exception license, because:
a) GPL2 with classpath exception captures the same intentions as LGPL and the wording is more suitable for Java projects.
b) The project now includes four files from OpenJDK8 which allow FreeHEP library to function under Java environments. The files are licensed under GPL2 with classpath exception.

See the file GPLv2-classpath.txt.
